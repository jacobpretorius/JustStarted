## Privacy Policy For JustStarted
Your privacy is very important to us. We will never sell or share your information.

With the release of v1.0.0 we have removed all Google Analytics tracking and all related collected tracking data has been deleted. For previous versions please see the [old privacy policy](https://github.com/jacobpretorius/JustStarted/blob/master/Privacy-Policy-v0.9.2.md).

We will **never access your Toggl account** or any of its related data. We also have no means to access your account.

**Your Toggl API key is never sent to any of our servers** or accessible by any of our staff, it stays on your device only.

**We cannot share personal identifying information**, even if legally required to do so, as **we don't have any**.

We cannot take any responsibility for the stability or privacy of the Toggl service as our application is a completely independent third-party application.

Your continued use of the JustStarted application will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 2 September 20202.
