# Privacy policy for JustStarted v0.1.0 to v0.9.9

(This policy only applies to old release versions of JustStared which included Google Analytics tracking, JustStarted v1.0.0 and thereafter includes no tracking and has a simplified [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/jacobpretorius/JustStarted/blob/master/privacy-policy.md).

Your privacy is very important to us. We will never sell or share your information. We will never access your Toggl account or any of its related data.

Your Toggl API key is never sent to any of our servers or accessible by any of our staff, it stays on your device.

It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from your usage of the JustStarted application.

The only service we use for tracking and application stability monitoring is Google Analytics. We use this service only to track "events" within the JustStarted application.

This is the specific information that we track in "events":

DeviceId.
Event Type.
Standard Google Analytics tracking information such as Time, Country, Operating system, etc.
A DeviceId is a randomly generated GUID which is stored locally on your device only. There is no way to link a DeviceId to a specific Toggl account, or to you as an individual.

An "event" is defined as an user initiated action, the specific events we track are:

Timer started.
Application launched/opened.
New user journey started.
Once again for clarity. We don't track who you are or what specific timers you start/stop in any way. We only track that a-device has started a-timer, or that a-device has opened the application.

We do not store any of this tracking data, Google Analytics handles all of the storage and protection with commercially acceptable (and industry standard) means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We cannot share personal identifying information, even to provide legal assistance, as we don't have it.

We cannot take any responsibility for the stability or privacy of the Toggl service as our application is a completely independent third-party application.

Your continued use of the JustStarted application will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.

This policy is effective as of 1 June 2019.
