# JustStarted
This application is intended for people who use [Toggl](https://toggl.com) to track which project they are currently working on. Works on Windows and Mac.

![Application interface](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacobpretorius/JustStarted/master/ScreenShot.PNG)

Each button is generated automatically from the user's list of projects in Toggl. 

## Installation
See [releases](https://github.com/jacobpretorius/JustStarted/releases) to download the latest version. The application will automatically download and install updates as they become available in the future.

## Usage
On first startup enter your "API token" from your [Toggl profile settings page](https://toggl.com/app/profile) and press enter. You should then see a list of project buttons generated automatically. Click one to start tracking.

Your API key is saved on your device only, to remove it enter any other text (or nothing at all) into the API field and press enter again.

## Limitations
- Currently the application only supports one workspace in Toggl and chooses the first one you have.
